# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Writing modularized code has always been at the forefront of my mind when constructing software. By focusing on not repeating lines of code, by creating functional objects and methods that can be used elsewhere throughout a project, and by using clear and concise comments, I strive for maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. The CRUD module I've created here could be implemented in other MongoDB structures quite easily due to this modularity.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Logically. Often a large-scale project can be daunting to work on, so breaking it down into smaller, easier to code problems is generally my strategy. For example, in this project that required a functional database dashboard solution, I simply began with writing the create() method. And by tackling one aspect of the project at a time, this snowballed into the final product with each previous module building into and cooperating with the next. This strategy also inherently breeds code that is structured modularly as described above.

# How would your work on this type of project help a company to do their work better?
Data collection and management solutions are paramount in a company's success, and having a succinct and user-friendly dashboard for them to access and manipulate goes a long way. A company is often collecting data on a day-to-day basis that covers most, if not all, aspects of their business. But enabling their employees to be able to access that data on a whim is what matters most. In implementing a solution such as this, anyone in the company can quickly plot data points against one another, analyze trends, keep track of inventory, etc. You name it. The benefits are close to endless.
